# Task-Management-Application

- This project is an Task Management Application. In this repository, I have included codes of the backend and frontend of the application.
- I have used MongoDB as the database to the application. 

1. Backend

    - The backend of the application is developed in Spring Boot technology.
    - The dependencies that I have used are installed at the beginning of the Spring Boot project which was intialized using Spring Intializer. 
    - The dependencies that I have used are mentioned below:
        1. Spring Boot Actuator
        2. Spring Web
        3. Lombok
        4. Spring Data MongoDB
        5.  Spring Security
     - To run and build the back end of the project we have to run the 'TaskManagementSystemApplication' file, which continues the main method of the backend project.
     - Security measures and error handling implemented:
        1. I have used try/catch method for error handling

2. Frontend
     - The frontend of the application is developed in ReactJs technology.
